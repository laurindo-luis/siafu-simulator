FlatData types:
==============================================================================
Siafu serializes all the context information using the FlatData classes. You 
will need these to use the get and set context methods, both directly or
through most wrappers (like the Web Service wrapper).

Check the javadoc for all the classes that implement Publishable. The 
constructor that takes a FlatData as input, or the flatten method will show
you how they work. If you don't want to wade through the code, that's fine
too, here's a quick reference:

de.nec.nle.siafu.model.Place:name#type#latitude#longitude
de.nec.nle.siafu.model.Position:Lat#Lon
TimePeriod:startHour#startMinute#endHour#endMinute
TextList:string1#string2#...
Text:string
IntegerNumber:int
FloatNumber:float
EasyTime:HH#MM
BooleanType:trueorfalse

If you intend on coding your own datatypes, bear in mind that the left hand 
side of the colon will be the name of the class if the class belongs to the
package de.nec.nle.siafu.types, and packagename.classname otherwise.
