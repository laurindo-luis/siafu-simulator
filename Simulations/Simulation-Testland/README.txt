This module can be imported as an eclipse project, it contains:
A very simple test simulation, used to try out the simulator and further
develop it. It comprises a labirynth-like map where agents wander around
zombie style. Three agents are special, however: Teresa and Pietro stay put
for the user to control, and the Postman runs errands from point A to B.
Tirelessly.
